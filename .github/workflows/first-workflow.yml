# This section covers the work to perform.
# We include one or more jobs in this section.
jobs:
  # Each individual job will include details like execution order,
  # pre-requisite jobs, and execution platform.
  job1:
    # We can run jobs on GitHub hosted VM runners in Windows, Ubuntu, and Mac OS.
    # We can also run jobs on self-hosted hardware.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Each job contains one or more steps. A step needs to have at least a name and a command.
    steps:
    - name: Step one
      # The 'run' command executes a shell or command script. Because this is Ubuntu, the
      # default run command will be /bin/bash
      run: echo "Log from step one"
      # This section does not appear in the solution file but demonstrates how to set
      # custom variables that will be available in the run script.

        VARIABLE_NAME: value
    - name: Step two
      run: echo "Log from step two"
      
  job2:
    # Job 2 will only run after job 1 completes.
    # Removing this 'needs' section would make the jobs run simultaneously.

    steps:

      # The 'with' block includes parameters that the workflow will pass
      # to this action. Parameters are all in key-value format.
