# Exercise 02 - Start working in GitHub

## Lab Scenario

Source control is a "must-have" for development projects today, and in this exercise, we will put together a GitHub repository that we will use for the rest of the training. But GitHub is about more than source control repositories. In this exercise, we will also cover GitHub project boards, which allow for collaboration between team members. We will also create a GitHub Actions workflow, which we can use to deploy code resources to remote destinations.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Clone an existing GitHub repository for your own use
* Add team members to your GitHub repository
* Build out a Kanban project board, including assigning issues to team members
* Create a GitHub Actions workflow

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 45 minutes
