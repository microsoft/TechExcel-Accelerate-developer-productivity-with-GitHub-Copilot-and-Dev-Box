# Exercise 03 - Improve and deploy your application

## Lab Scenario

In the prior exercise, you worked with key GitHub components, such as repositories, project boards, and GitHub Actions workflows. In this exercise, you will build upon that prior work by showing how to perform a code modification using the GitFlow method. You will build upon your prior GitHub Actions workflows efforts by creating a new workflow to deploy Azure resources using a Bicep script. You will also build out a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) process, automatically building and deploying changes whenever you check application code changes into specific GitHub branches.

Along the way, you will also have an opportunity to use GitHub Copilot to assist with application development changes, showing the staff at Munson's Pickles and Preserves how they can take advantage of GitHub Copilot in their own day-to-day work.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Install and use the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code
* Modify a .NET application by following the GitFlow workflow
* Deploy Azure resources using a Bicep script in a GitHub Actions workflow
* Deploy containerized .NET applications as part of a build process
* Implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) with GitHub Actions workflows

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 75 minutes
